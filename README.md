This extension turns `.txt` files into fully executable & debuggable programs. Users can specify their programs with English language, organize the logic across different files if desired
& set breakpoints in the text just like they are used to.

# Features
* Specify program behavior in human language. 
* Specify logic across different `.txt` files that can be reused & imported.

2. (Temporary) Note the extension requires the `github-copilot` extension to also be installed.
3. Define your program across `.txt` files and execute/debug them!
